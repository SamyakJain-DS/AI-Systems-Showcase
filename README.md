# 🚀 AI Apps Showcase

A centralized **portfolio hub** showcasing multiple **production-minded AI applications** built using modern GenAI techniques such as multimodal reasoning, agentic workflows, and real-time tool integration.

This repository serves as a **single entry point** to explore my applied AI projects - each designed, implemented, and deployed end-to-end.

## ✨ Purpose

This Streamlit app acts as a **product-style showcase** rather than a single demo.  
It highlights:

- Real-world problem framing
- Thoughtful prompt and system design
- Tool-augmented reasoning
- Deployment constraints and robustness
- Clear communication of AI capabilities

---

## 🧠 Featured Applications

### 🎨 AI Story Generator
A multimodal generative storytelling system that converts user-uploaded images into genre-aware short stories, grounded in visual context using Gemini Vision. Includes prompt evaluation, state-safe Streamlit UI, and expressive voice narration via a local neural TTS pipeline.

**Key concepts:**  
Multimodal AI · Vision-Language Models · Prompt Evaluation · Neural TTS · Streamlit Deployment

---

### 🧠 AI Daily Briefing Agent
An agentic AI assistant that dynamically reasons over real-time tools to produce a complete, actionable daily plan. It retrieves live weather data, recent news, and verified local events, then synthesizes them into a structured schedule while strictly avoiding hallucinated or vague recommendations.

**Key concepts:**  
Agentic AI · Tool Use · LangChain Agents · Real-time APIs · Planning & Reasoning

---

### 🔮 Upcoming AI Project
An additional AI application currently in development, focused on deeper reasoning, personalization, or automation. This project will continue the emphasis on **production-ready GenAI systems** and real-world applicability.

## 🎯 Final Note

This repository is intentionally structured as a portfolio showcase, not a single-use application.
Each linked project demonstrates a different dimension of applied AI system design - from multimodal generation to agent-based reasoning.

More applications will be added over time.
